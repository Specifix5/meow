# meowbot

A multi-purpose, all-in-one discord bot \
⚠️ (code is very :sob:)

## Setting up the project
* Set up the environment variables defined in `.env.example` on an `.env` file
* Create a new json file in the main directory called `random_anime.json`, this will be the file containing all pics and its sources that is displayed in the help command.
```json
[
  {
    "src": "SOURCE LINK",
    "url": "URL TO TRANSPARENT IMAGE"
  },
  // ... Add more to your liking.
]
```
* You should be able to run meowbot by typing `cargo run dev`
